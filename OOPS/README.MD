# Object Oriented Programming System (OOPS)

OOPS in java is to improve code readability and reusability by defining a java program efficiently.

## The main principles of OOPS in java are: 
                                            Classes/Objects
                                            Encapsulation/data-hidding
                                            Abstraction/interfaces
                                            Inheritance
                                            Polymorphism




# Encapsulation
It is the process by which data(variables) and the code acts upon them(methods) are integreted as a single unit. other class can not acces the data of a class, only methods can accessed



# Abstraction
abstraction class in java is the process of hiding the intricate code implementation from the user and just provides the user with necessary information



# Inheritance
inheritance in java is a concept that acquires all the propierties from one class to another class, the class which inherits is called sub-class/child-class and from which class child class inherits the propierties is called super-class/parent-class



# Polymorphism
polymorphism means 'many forms' and it occurs when we have many classes related to each other by inheritance
