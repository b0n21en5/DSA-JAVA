# Object Oriented Programming System (OOPS)

OOPS in java is to improve code readability and reusability by defining a java program efficiently.

## The main principles of OOPS in java are: 
                                            Classes/Objects
                                            Encapsulation/data-hidding
                                            Abstraction/interfaces
                                            Inheritance
                                            Polymorphism
