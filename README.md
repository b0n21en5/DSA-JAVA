### Notes to remind of:
                      * embedded: portable, reuseable, reliable with embedded systems
                      * secure: compile code into a binary byte interpreted on JVM
                      * robust: utilizes strong memory management by bypassing security dilemmas
                      * architecture neutral: 4 bits of memory for both 32 & 64 bit architeure
                      * high performance: byte code is close to native code
                      * distributed: facilitates users to create distributed apps (RMI & EJB)
                      * multi-threaded: doesn't occupy memory for each thread, shares a common memory area
                      * dynamic: classes are loaded on demand also supports functions from native languages i.e. C, C++
